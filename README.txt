Package details
--------------

Package includes the following files:
- Zange_634Final_Code.ipynb - iPython file containing final version of code
- /.ipynb_checkpoints - directory of supporting files for the iPython file
- Zange_634Final_Paper.pdf - the final paper summarizing the entire project
- Zange_634Final_README.txt - this document

For further details on the data and this project, please consult Zange_634Final_Paper

How to run code
--------------

To run the code, you will need a iPython environment like Jupyter Lab or equivalent.
Jupyter lab is included in the Anaconda distribution of Python.
Python 3 is used for this project.
For more details on resources used for this project, please consult Zange_634Final_Paper, specifically
the Resources section.

Once you have a Jupyter Lab environment open within the project directory, open the
Zange_634Final_Code.ipynb to see fully executed code. Outputs are already included in the
iPython blocks, so running of the code is not needed to view completed status.
If rerunning becomes necessary, you may restart the kernel and rerun all outputs using
the Kernel dropdown menu at the top of the window.
